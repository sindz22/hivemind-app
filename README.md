## Environment Setup & EAS Build Configuration

### Local Development
To run this application locally, you must define the required environment variables:
1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Open `.env` and fill in your actual API keys and configurations:
   - **EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY**: Generate a key in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
   - **EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_***: Get these credentials from your Project Settings in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

### Secure EAS Builds
For cloud builds (Expo Application Services), DO NOT commit your `.env` file or hardcode keys. Instead, use EAS Secrets:
1. Ensure your keys are prefixed with `EXPO_PUBLIC_` (e.g., `EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY`).
2. Add these variables to your Expo project dashboard under **Project Settings > Secrets**, or define them using the EAS CLI:
   ```bash
   eas secret:create --name EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY --value your-gemini-key
   eas secret:create --name EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY --value your-firebase-key
   # Repeat for other Firebase variables
   ```
Expo's build system dynamically injects any EAS secrets starting with `EXPO_PUBLIC_` into the application bundle during compilation.


## Problem Statement

Students often switch between multiple applications for scheduling, focus sessions, collaboration, notes, and progress tracking. This fragmented workflow creates distractions and reduces productivity.

- Productivity tools
- Smart planning
- Real-time collaboration
- Learning resources
- Progress analytics


## Future Scope

- AI-generated personalized quizzes
